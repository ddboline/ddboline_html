<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One of the
most difficult and important skills for scientists of any gender is giving
lectures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Public speaking is a learned
skill that requires practice, effort, and building up confidence.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lectures are a tremendous opportunity to
tell other scientists what you have accomplished, and to influence scientific
discovery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lectures on research are
required in job interviews for all scientist-level positions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a lecture, a large group of people pays
attention to you and your accomplishments for typically 50 minutes, during
which they are going to form some opinion about your ability as a scientist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Women know
that the way we dress has a big effect on others’ first impression of us, and
there are many pitfalls involved with dressing to give a lecture.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The most serious wardrobe mistake that can
be made by a young woman giving a professional talk is to wear clothing that is
designed to make men think about sex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>While you might get away with plunging necklines, bare midriffs, low-cut
pants, shirts without sleeves, mini-skirts, spiked heels, and overly dangly
jewelry in other contexts, even in the workplace, this clothing is far too
distracting for a presentation in which you are already the focus of
attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wearing suggestive clothing
is guaranteed to focus your audience on various parts of your anatomy, rather
than listening to the message you are trying to communicate.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is confusing to young women, since
women are routinely expected to wear such things when they dress up for a
“formal occasion.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When men dress up
for work, they wear a suit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When men
dress up for romance, they wear a suit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Women must make a distinction here between appropriate professional
clothing, which can look feminine and pretty but not sexy, and appropriate
dating-wear, which is supposed to look sexy if you want it to work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have been at talks in which a young woman
has worn clothing that is so distracting that even I have had some difficulty
paying attention to what she was saying – and of course when she was finished
there was not a single question from the audience.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>One of the ways a speaker measures the success of her talk is by the
quantity and quality of the questions received at the end.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If there are no questions, then people
either are not interested or had absolutely no idea what you were saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
pitfalls of dressing for lectures do not end here.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The first thing that happens when you stand up to give your lecture
is that the organizer or session chair hands you a microphone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Women typically do not have the deep booming
voices that carry over lecture halls, and should use amplification at every
opportunity; there is nothing worse than preparing and delivering a perfectly
inaudible lecture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The microphone comes
with an alligator clip that is designed to attach to the front of a button-down
shirt such as is being worn by most men giving talks, and a battery pack that
clips to the pocket, belt, or pants waist included in all male attire.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Women who are not prepared for this often
start their talks with an awkward exchange with the session chair while they
try to figure out how this apparatus might be attached.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I used to wear men’s plaid or striped short
sleeved shirts and Land’s End khaki pants for lectures, since the alligator
clips used to only clip in the direction that men’s button-down shirts
open.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Short sleeved men’s shirts look
like they could be women’s shirts when worn by women, but the extra-long sleeves
and wide wrist closures on men’s long sleeved shirts make them difficult to
feminize.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nowadays, most of the
microphone clips can be switched from one orientation to the other, so they can
be clipped on to women’s shirts as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If you wear a skirt or pants made of a sturdy fabric, then you have a
waistband on which the battery pack can be clipped.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Once I wore silk pants when giving a talk, and the battery pack
bulged out on the side, threatening to rip out the pocket.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When speaking, I usually wear a wool or
cotton skirt, a cotton button-down shirt, and a jacket or vest.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the alligator clip cannot be attached to
my shirt for any reason, it can be clipped to the jacket or vest.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Fashion boots can be easily worn with a
skirt, and if chosen well are a comfortable and secure alternative to heels,
which are a trip hazard when nervous and walking on polished floors
crisscrossed with temporary wiring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It is
important to test both the verbal and visual presentation of your talk before
giving it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Beginning speakers should
always practice their talks before giving them (once for hour long talks, 3
times for 20 minute talks, and 12 times for 5 minute talks).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Your advisors probably finish their talks
the night before or on the plane on the way to the conference, but they only
get away with this after long practice and because each talk at this stage in
their careers is not as critical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Good
speakers make all of their most important points in the allotted time, with
sufficient time left over for questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The shorter the talk, the more planning this requires.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the presentation is being made with
transparencies, the important points can be written on Post-It notes attached
to each slide as a reminder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>PowerPoint
slides can be printed out in thumbnail size with reminders written next to each
slide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In most cases you can put these
on the table next to your laptop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Alternatively you can write your points on 3x5 cards and hold them in
one hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You should practice your talk
once in front of friends or co-workers who can offer you constructive
suggestions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Listen constructively to
any criticism, and revise your talk in any way <i>you</i> feel is
beneficial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Live audiences give you a
better assessment of how your talk will come off under pressure.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These practice talks are often more
difficult because you feel silly explaining your project to a group of people
who know most of the information already, but they are necessary for beginning
speakers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Always test your visuals enough
before the presentation to make changes if necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>If possible, these should be tested in the room in which the
presentation will be given.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Photographs
are often difficult to make out on overhead transparencies (and black
transparencies heat up quickly).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Computer projected (e.g. PowerPoint) slides often appear different
colors in the projector than on your laptop, and innumerable technical problems
can be encountered with connection cords, screen resolutions, operating system
incompatibilities, movies that will not load or play, etc.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sometimes conference organizers request
electronic copies of the talk ahead of time since they will be played on local
equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sometimes the speaker brings
the talk on her own laptop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In either
case, the visuals should be tested by the speaker on the same equipment that
will be used for the talk, enough in advance so that technical problems may be
addressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a backup, always have a
copy of the talk on separate electronic media (CD, memory clip, etc.) or
available for electronic transfer over the Worldwide Web.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Alternatively, the most important visuals
can be printed out as transparencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If you are traveling to speak, your talk should come with you in your
carry-on luggage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When young
women start their talks, the first words are often an apology or self-deprecating
comment of some sort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I once saw a
young woman win one of a handful of national awards for astronomy given out
once per year at the American Astronomical Association.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In her first sentence, she declared that the
judges had made a big mistake in choosing her for the award.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although I think this was supposed to be
partly a joke, it was also a statement of her recognition that the research for
which she was receiving an award was really the combined work of many minds and
fingers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As women, we tend to see
scientific endeavor as a web of activity, and to work in groups to accomplish a
common goal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is somewhat foreign for
us to think about distinguishing ourselves - moving ourselves up through a ranking
or pecking order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The boys learned
these techniques on the playgrounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
were instead learning empathy, understanding our emotions, and helping each
other in daily chores.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is true that
for any award there may be many others as equally deserving of the award as the
person who received it, and that no great scientific discovery is really the
result of just one person’s work and ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, each of those awards is deserved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>With each
general tendency I identify between the way women and men conduct their lives,
I ask myself whether this trait makes women less capable as scientists.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Working together in daily chores can be an
advantage to the pursuit of new knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, the expressions of self-doubt are distracting and serve little
purpose in a lecture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is somewhat of
a taboo in a circle of women to assert or assume that you know everything.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is a sign of weakness for men to question
their own abilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If a woman shows
through her words and manner that even she does not believe in her own
abilities, then a man will find it quite reasonable that he should not believe
in them, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So don’t start out
communicating your self-doubt, and don’t slip it in periodically as you
speak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Listen to yourself when you
practice the talk, and make sure you sound confident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A particularly
important example of why the male way of thinking can be a real asset to
communication involves answering a simple question posed about research
results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sometimes I have been asked
what the size scale of an image that I am presenting is, or how long it takes
for a dwarf galaxy to orbit around the Milky Way, and I have said, “I don’t
know.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Big mistake.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While it is sometimes okay to say “I don’t
know,” in a dismissive way that communicates “I don’t know, I don’t care, and
it is not important” when asked a detailed question about a fine point you have
not thought about, the questioner will be much more satisfied and everyone will
learn more if you tell the audience what you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>do</i> know about the question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The person who asked what the scale of my image was did not care whether
it was 5 arcminutes or 10 arcminutes, but would have been happy to know that it
was at least not arcseconds or degrees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I knew that it was a piece of a 13 arcminute image, but did not know how
big the piece was so I simply said, “I don’t know.”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>This answer gave the audience the impression that I did not have
any idea what I was talking about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In that
same lecture, a physicist asked me what a quasar was.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Now, of course I knew that most astronomers think that a quasar
is a black hole with stuff falling into it in an accretion disk, and that for
some reason it is ejecting charged particles along its magnetic poles.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But I haven’t critically reviewed the
literature and I don’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>know</i> that’s
what it really is, and I do not understand the physics of how energy of stuff
falling in with the accretion disk is channeled into charged particles spewing
out of magnetic poles, so my first reaction was to say, “I don’t know.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is a much simpler answer than the complex
thoughts I am having in response to that question.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I then realized that was the wrong answer, and communicated
basically what I have said above while waving my hands around and saying that
was a hand-wavy answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although I
think my answer was a fair assessment of the definition of a quasar as I know
it, I am afraid it lacked the clarity and confidence that would have given the
audience confidence in my answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
communicated instead my incredible ability to lose confidence in myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After the
talk, the head of the laboratory came up to me and said, “You know what your
problem is, you do not say what you know.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>My first (internal) reaction to this was angry and defensive.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I grouped this comment with a consistent
history of people who had come up to me after my talks to give me negative
feedback.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ever since I had started
giving professional talks in graduate school, someone important had given me a
negative comment or suggestion for improvement after every talk.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And I heard the criticism loud and clear
while I barely registered the positive remarks I received (those after all,
were expected).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I had become more
nervous about speaking with every negative comment from a senior
scientist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I realize now that the
laboratory director was really trying to help me out – the best way a male
scientist born well before 1945 knew how.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Those of us who have been mothers or wives know that the best way to
effectively deliver criticism is to mix praise with criticism, and we would
never start with anything like “You know what your problem is …”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It took me a long time to hear the rest of
the sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe if I had been a
male he wouldn’t have said this to me at all, or I wouldn’t have heard it, or I
wouldn’t have made the mistake in the first place.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is an advantage for us as women if we can hear this criticism,
ignore the parts that are unfair, hurtful, untrue, and break down our
confidence, and use the helpful parts to improve our performance in our
careers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our most devastating
disadvantage comes from ignoring the helpful information and dwelling on the
voices that doubt us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Before any
talk, it is important to figure out what you would like your audience to
remember after it is over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are
some people who are very good at listening, and will hear and understand every
sentence that you utter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most people,
myself included, lapse in and out of attention during the presentation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One way to reach those with questionable
listening talent is to outline the main points that you are going to present
right up front, when they’re still awake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Then, you spend the body of the talk explaining the main points, being
sure to spend sufficient time explaining each plot, picture, or idea.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You then end with the conclusions, which
reiterate the main points you want to get across, trying to keep them all on
the same visual if possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The visual
parts of the presentation should be self-contained and self-explanatory.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some people don’t listen well, but read
everything on the slides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The labels on
all plots should be large enough and the symbols defined well enough that the
person who returns to consciousness in the middle of your description of the
plot can attempt to catch up with you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>At the end of the talk, which you end by saying, “I will end there,” or
“Are there any questions?” your list of conclusions should still be
visible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many people in the audience at
this point are going to search themselves for questions, and the conclusions
will jog their memories as to what you have said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It aids in the formulation of questions, which are one of the
more important components of the talk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For the
beginning speaker, the prospect of a question can be daunting.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No one, even the most expert researcher in
your particular area, will know the answer to every question.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What is important in the question session is
to make sure you understand the question – sometimes by repeating it, to think
about what you know about the answer, and to answer it as fully and correctly
as you are able, while displaying confidence in your answer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>People ask questions for many reasons.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sometimes, they ask a question because there
is something about your talk that they truly do not understand.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sometimes they ask a question because they
do not believe something that you said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Sometimes they ask a question in an attempt to cut you down and make
themselves look important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sometimes
they ask a question to make themselves look knowledgeable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And sometimes the question is merely an
attempt to get you to speak some more because they are interested.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whatever the question, it can be answered
with respect and dignity, to the fullest extent you know the answer, and
without apology for those parts you do not know or techniques you have not
tried.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Try to spend more time telling
us what you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do</i> know or think about
than what you do not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If a question is
very detailed or in your opinion not of general interest to the audience, you
can offer to answer a complex question in person after your talk; but do not
overuse this response as it could be interpreted as “I don’t know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Do not worry
if you do not get everything exactly correct, but just try your best.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is an advantage of your colleagues that
they do not remember ever having been wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I learned a lot about the male mind one day from my husband, who is also
a scientist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was pouring water from
a plastic bottle into a glass, and when setting down the bottle managed to
knock both the glass and the bottle off the kitchen table.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He caught the glass before it fell, but the
bottle and its contents spilled out onto the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>He turned to look at me and said, “Hmm, it’s a good thing I
noticed that the bottle was plastic and saved the glass instead, or we would
have had broken glass on the floor.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
thought, “The guy just knocked a bottle of water off the table and all over the
floor, and his reaction is to congratulate himself on not having broken the
glass as well!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ability to see your
own faults can be a big advantage to making scientific discoveries or managing
a project, but it can also be major handicap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The men are just forging ahead and getting work done while we are
reflecting on how we could have handled it all better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Women who
have on previous occasions responded to male egos with paralysis, and
discovered to their surprise that they are therefore not thought to be
intelligent, sometimes react by covering their insecurity with anger and
frustration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead of respecting the
question and answering in the best possible way, they attack.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is altogether too easy for a woman to be
labeled, “difficult,” because of her negative reaction to a playing field that
she never understood, and a lower ranking in the pecking order (that she never
understood she was fighting for) than she thinks she deserves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And always keep smiling.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are men out there who walked into the
room not understanding why you are pursuing your career in the first
place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you give them the impression
that you are not enjoying it, or are not successful, they will be sure you will
not survive in your career.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In hiring
decisions and conferring awards, a scientist’s enthusiasm and commitment to the
field are often held in even higher regard than the assessment of talent.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a world that judges us on the success of
our associates, who wants to risk a relationship with a person who might not be
serious about continuing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Women hear
the doubts, the criticism, and the fears of the scientific community loud and
clear, even when unspoken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If we turn
that external doubt into self-doubt, then our failure to succeed becomes a

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Note from the author:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Woman Physicist’s Guide to Speaking does not
cover all issues faced by women physicists, but instead gives one example that
partially illustrates the tilted the playing field.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Very rarely does a male physicist ever face a clothing issue,
miss the need to establish a pecking order, or waste energy on water that has
flowed under the bridge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Men are never
assumed to be products of affirmative action or accused of sleeping their way
to the top.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Physicists usually do not
question the sensibility of their male colleague’s career choices or wonder
whether they will leave the field when they become parents.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All male physicists have to think about is
doing their job, and doing it well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><i>The good news is that the great
majority of the barrier to becoming a successful woman physicist in today’s
climate can be overcome by making very small changes to <u>ourselves</u>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How hard is it really to put together a few
good outfits for giving talks, to learn to speak with confidence, and to curb
our response to negative feedback?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And
if we do this, our natural abilities to handle several issues at once, work and
manage teams, communicate, prioritize our time, and pay attention to details
will make it even easier for us succeed in our chosen career.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
