RewriteEngine On
# This will enable the Rewrite capabilities

RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
# This checks to make sure the connection is not already HTTPS

RewriteRule ^/?secure/(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/secure/$1 [R,L]
# This rule will redirect all users who are using any part of /secure/ to the same location but using HTTPS.
# i.e.  http://www.example.com/secure/ to https://www.example.com/secure/
# This means if you dont want to force HTTPS for all directories you can force it for a specific sub-section of the site.
